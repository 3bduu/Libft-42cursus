## Introduction

The Libft project provides a collection of custom C functions that are commonly used in programming tasks. These functions can be used as a replacement for their standard C library counterparts or as utility functions to simplify and accelerate the development of various C programming projects.

## Usage

To use the Libft library in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/3bduu/Libft-42cursus.git
2. Include the necessary header files in your C source files: #include "libft.h"
3. Compile your project with the Libft library: gcc -o your_program your_program.c -L/path/to/libft -lft
4. Run your program: ./your_program
